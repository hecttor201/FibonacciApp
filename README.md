# FibonacciApp
Project Fibonacci

This API is created to obtain a number from the Fibonacci sequence positions.

The first thing I did was to create a service in which the logic for obtaining the number will be processed. In this class, I will create the calculateFibonacci method with a parameter to receive the index of the number we want to obtain. The first thing I did was to validate the first 2 positions to ensure that the Fibonacci sequence will start correctly with 0 and 1. Then, we created a for loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence, and there we will obtain the number depending on the index we specify.

We can make improvements or adjustments to create variations of this sequence. For example, instead of starting with 1, we can specify a number to start the sequence.
